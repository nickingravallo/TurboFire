- Originally started project Jan. 2025
  - Went into project without much experience
  - Attempted to 'brute force' monte carlo sim

- Revived project October
  - Attempted to make Monte Carlo simulation with poker AI
  - Did not realize perfect hashing algorithm would required to be used

December 2025 / January 2026:
  - Attempted to use Cursor to 'vibe code' a GTO solver to see how close it could get, replicating it by hand later
  - Failed attempt

- 2026-01-18 -
  - Attempted again to vibe code the whole slover, it failed. A better plan was likely needed

- 2026-01-19 -
  - Began using Gemini in an attempt to understand the OMPEval hand hashing code and implementing it

- 2026-01-22 -
  - Attempted another GTO Solver using AI agents with Claude, and OMPEval using MCCFR.
  - This time with a better structured plan in plan-2026-01-22.txt
  - Although I was able to produce a GTO solver based on the input, it really struggled in terms of functionality
  - It couldn't "understand" the goal of what I wanted and bugs were persistent if I could not handle it first time around

- 2026-01-29 - 
  - Used Gemini to help build the rank verifier
  - Used Claude to generate the fix for non-flush ranks
